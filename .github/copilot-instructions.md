## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to implement the chat functionality in the BanglaGhar project. The feature includes a chat button in the Navbar, a chat modal interface, and integration with the property details page to start a chat with the property owner.

  - Retrieves the current user's token from `localStorage` and includes it in the request headers for authentication.

### 5. Backend Authentication Middleware
- **File Used**: `server/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

  - The backend uses the `authMiddleware` to authenticate requests and retrieve the current user's details from the token.

### 6. WebSocket Integration

  - Listened for incoming messages and updated the chat interface in real-time.
  - Emitted messages to the server when the send button is clicked.

### 8. Installed `socket.io-client`
